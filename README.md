# RPCS3-PCSX2-notrdic-theme
A nordic theme made for PCSX2 and RPCS3


i used [This](https://www.nordtheme.com/) website as the reference of the color palette, it looks clean on the eyes and has good contrast for my liking. i added some comment for what each line does, but its mediocre at best so i hope you have fun if you want to edit them.

i made this with trial and error and looking at other themes so i probably missed a lot of stuff and it can be improved , i had no idea what anyone of them was when making them so if you know more and want to help me make it better it will be awsome. 

have fun i guess
